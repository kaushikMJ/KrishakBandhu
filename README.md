A one-stop website , where farmer can list their crops for sale and buyer can buy listed crops from a farmer.
The web portal  have two interfaces: 1)Farmer login   2)Buyer login



A farmer has to register himself first and have to give his details that includes his contact detials and location details.

Then the farmer can log in by entering his registered email Id and password.

After the login is successful,the webpage redirects to his own home page,where he gets a welcome message.

To list his crops for sale,the farmer can click on 'Make Request' option in the navigation bar.

Upon clicking the 'Make Request' option,he has to fill the crop details,that includes the name of crop,cultivation season,sowing date,harvested date,production quantity  
and area of cultivation.

The farmer may forget what were the crops he listed in the past.
To solve this problem,we introduced the option of 'Your Listings' in the navigation bar.Upon clicking it he gets the details of the crops he listed in the past.




On the other side, there would be Buyerâ€™s Login. 

The buyer has to register the company first and have to give the details that includes  contact detials and location details.

Then the farmer can log in by entering his registered email Id and password.

After the login is successful,the webpage redirects to the home page,where a welcome message is displayed.

To look for the crops that are listed,there is the option 'Crops to Buy' in the navigation bar.

Upon clicking the option,the buyer can get all the details of the listed crops,that includes contact details and location details of the farmer.




Hence, the portal could help in displaying the produce of a farmer to several buyers, without worrying him to ask each and every buyer separately. 
This would help the farmer in getting the appropriate buyer, no matter how remotely he is located. 
None of the produce would be wasted. 
Even the private buyers could get a chance of purchasing from higher number of farmers directly across any location.

New features will be added soon...
